**Document similarity with tf_idf and cosine similarity**

My solution for Labeler question in Quora Challenges.

The challenge is to predict categories for a question using labelled training data. Complete problem description can be found here - https://www.quora.com/about/challenges#labeler

The solution is to find feature vectors for labelled questions and use Natural Language Processing techniques to find similarity for a test question. The categories of most similar questions will be returned as categories for this new question.
